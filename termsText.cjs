Ahmed Iqbal, a Director of the Practice, will have overall responsibility for the matter and the supervision of my work. We may be assisted by other members of staff as the matter progresses.\n\nWe enclose/attach herewith for your attention:\n\nNCBA Retainer (Non-contentious Business Agreement) which applies to our fees;\n\nClient Information\n\nIf you have any further queries on the above (which we have discussed with you) please feel free to give your lawyer a call.\n\nAs a matter of practice policy, to enable us to comply with our obligations under professional regulations, and minimise the risk of fraud and identity theft, we require all new clients to provide evidence of identity, which should include a copy of signed photo evidence (e.g. a driving licence, passport, or identity card) together with a utility bill or similar verifying your address. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. These measures are for your own protection and security.\n\nThis form will enable us to obtain records or information from your creditors or other third parties which may assist.\n\nYour Instructions\n\nWe confirm that your instructions are as follows:\n\nTo pursue your claim for irresponsible lending. If this fails, then we may pursue the matter with the Financial Ombudsman.\n\nWould you kindly let us know if we are incorrect in any of the above details.\n\nPreliminary Advice\n\nWe would confirm our initial advice to you that after reviewing your Subject Access Review we have calculated that you potentially have a claim against your lender for irresponsible lending.\n\nPlease ensure that you do not directly discuss any details of the matter with the other side or any other person. If you are sent any correspondence or receive any telephone calls, simply advise them to contact your solicitor, and pass them onto us. Once we are instructed, they must not contact you directly on the matter, and you should not contact them or their insurers, as it could severely prejudice your case\n\nIt is vital that we can contact you at all times until your case is settled. Please inform us in writing of any change of address or telephone number, as failure to do so could delay and prejudice your claim. Please also tell us at once of any proceedings you are aware of relating to the matter and forward copies of any documents receive straight away. Once you have told us something, should changes occur, please inform us in writing. Kindly note, we cannot deal with any other person on your behalf without your written authority in advance.\n\nKindly note, we cannot deal with any other person on your behalf without your written authority in advance.\n\nFurtherance of Instructions\n\nWe will shortly be submitting our letter of complaint on your behalf to your lender.\n\nYour present instructions are to submit the letter of complaint and seek redress from your lender for any refunds that may be due as a result of the irresponsible lending. We will endeavour to complete this within a period of 3 months.\n\nIn the meantime, we would be obliged if you would let us know if your lender contacts you via telephone, letter or any other method.\n\nOur Retainer(s) with you: what you will pay us\n\nWe refer to the accompanying Additional Client Information on Financial Services Claims.\n\nFurther to our telephone conversation, when we advised on funding options (summarised in the accompanying Client Information), we confirm we are prepared to accept instructions under an NCBA.\n\nUnder the NCBA you only pay if your claim succeeds, when you will pay us the Agreed Percentage (and Additional Agreed percentage if applicable) of any Compensation.\n\nThe Success Fee has been calculated in accordance with the risk assessment which we have undertaken and is summarised below.\n\nRedress Amount Received by Client\n\nMaximum Fee Allowed + VAT\n\n£1 - £1,499\n\n30% (max £420)\n\n£1,500 - £9,999\n\n28% (max £2,500)\n\n£10,000 - £24,999\n\n25% (max £5,000)\n\n£25,000 - £49,999\n\n20% (max £7,500)\n\n£50,000 or more\n\n15% (max £10,000)\n\nFEE EXAMPLE (in the form of a reduction of a debt)\n\nLet us suppose that you are offered a £2,000 reduction in the overdraft, in response to your claim:\n\nThe fee is calculated based on band 2 (see table above): 33%\n\nThe fee payable to us will be £672\n\nYour debt, loan or overdraft will be reduced by £2000\n\nThis process protects you from any potential negative costs consequences in that should your claim fail or rejected by the Ombudsman there will be no costs to pay by you. We advise that\n\nWe do not instigate court proceedings litigate on matters such as this, if this is an avenue that you wish to pursue then you must seek alternative legal representation. Our services are limited to calculating your losses, submitting a letter of complaint and if applicable submitting a claim to the Financial Ombudsman (FOS).\n\nWe would remind you that (FOS) is a free of charge service to you. However, in our experience they will be unable to calculate the amount that you may be entitled to and this is within our area of expertise.\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nThe Agreed Percentages in the NCBA have been set in accordance with the risk assessment which we have undertaken in respect of your instructions, would confirm as follows:\n\nThe deferment of our fees until the conclusion of your Claim which may, if it goes before the Ombudsman be for up to 6 to 12 months;\n\nThe risk that we will receive no fees at all if your Claim does not succeed or be reimbursed the costs of running your claim, and, even if your claim succeeds, may well receive less than if we were paid under our ordinary hourly rates on a private retainer;\n\nThe fact that, by running your claim we are committing ourselves to an upfront and ongoing investment in, and commitment to, financing your claim over a relatively long period of time, which we may not recoup;\n\nYour claim depends upon relatively complex issues of law and fact, which we will have to investigate; and\n\nThe fact that the quantum of your Claim is highly uncertain.\n\nThird Party Authorities/ Commission\n\nYou may care to note that we may pay recommendation fee/agency fee/marketing of between £100 to £350.00 excluding VAT in respect of your instructions. As explained in the accompanying terms of retainer, this will not add to our Costs or otherwise reduce the amount of compensation which you receive. We are an independent practice of lawyers, and advice or assistance which will always be in your best interests. We will not disclose any information to the marketing/claims company without your consent and any consent provided can be revoked at any point.\n\nKindly note, we are not permitted to pay your damages to any third party (or forward any cheque made out to you to them), even where you have given us written authority to do so, unless they operate a designated client account (certified by an independent accountant) and have given us an undertaking that the money will be paid to you in full without delay, and indemnify us in respect of any losses, damages, costs, awards, penalties or fines where they fail to do so, including the costs and expenses of any proceedings in connection therewith.\n\nWhat You Need To Do Now\n\nTo allow us to start work immediately, could you please now:\n\nSign and return the attached retainers and all authorities attached hereto;\n\nProvide proof of identity;\n\nLet us know if any details of instructions as summarised herein are incorrect; and\n\nProvide any information or documents we have requested.\n\nIf you have any concerns at any time do raise them with me. If I am not able to resolve these, you are free to contact the Compliance Officer for Legal Practice at these offices. Our client care procedures are referenced at the end of the enclosed retainer, including details of the Legal Ombudsman Service.\n\nIf you have any queries regarding these arrangements, kindly give me a call.\n\nYours sincerely \n\nRowan Rose Solicitors\n\n1.

ABOUT US\n\nWho We Are\n\n1.1\n Rose Solicitors is the trading style of Rowan Rose Limited, a company registered in England and Wales (Company Number 12916452), whose registered office is 12 Exchange Quay, Salford, Salford, United Kingdom, M5 3EQ. We refer you to our entry on the website of the Law Society of England and Wales (the 'Law Society'): https://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/\n\n1.2\n Our website can be found at: https://www.rowanrose.co.uk/\n\n1.3\n We are members of the Law Society of England &amp; Wales, authorised and regulated as a recognised body of solicitors by the Solicitors Regulatory Authority (SRA). Our SRA number is 8000843. The Code of Conduct can be accessed at their website: www.sra.org.uk.\n\n1.4\n The SRA can be contacted at: \n(in writing) The Cube, 199 Wharfside Street, Birmingham, B1 1RN \n(by telephone) on 0370 606 2555 (inside the UK), 08:00 to 18:00, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday or 09:30 to 18:00 on Tuesday. \n(by email): contactcentre@sra.org.uk\n\nCompensation Fund\n\n1.5\n The SRA has a Compensation Fund out of which they may make grants to clients who have suffered loss by reason of the dishonesty of a solicitor or an employee of a solicitor's practice or loss in connection with a trust of which the solicitor is a trustee.\n\nProfessional Indemnity Insurance\n\n1.6\n The SRA Indemnity Insurance Rules, in force from time to time, oblige us to take out and maintain Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) with an approved participating insurer to the prescribed value of £3MK. Information about the PII we have incepted, including the contact details of our insurers and territorial coverage of the policy, is available at our registered office. PII protects you, if a solicitor is in the breach of the duty of care which they owe to clients (and others) and negligently fail to do something that should have done of conduct of instructions falls short of the professional duty oof care, and you suffer financial loss or damage in consequence. You are not charged for having the benefit of this cover.\n\nFinancial Services\n\n1.7\n The Law Society is a designated professional body under Part XX of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 which means that We can carry out exempt regulated activities without the need for authorisation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), where services arise out of, or are complementary to, the provision of legal services to You. \n\n1.8\n The limited regulated activities that We carry out include, and are restricted to issuing certain insurance policies, such as after the event legal expenses insurance, defective title insurance and other property indemnity insurance (i.e. in respect absence of easement, lack of planning permission, unknown rights, and covenants policies). \n\n1.9\n We are not authorised by the FCA, but on the register maintained by them, which can be accessed via the FCA website: www.fca.org.uk/firms/financial-services-register. \n\n1.10\n Registration entitles Us to carry on insurance distribution activity i.e. advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts. This part of Our business is regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, and any complaints in that respect, if they cannot be resolved under Our internal complaints' procedures, are dealt with by the Legal Ombudsman. \n\n1.11\n Any insurance policy arranged by Us on your behalf, shall, in Our opinion, be adequate to meet Your needs, but We do not recommend any policy over and above any other. It is Your responsibility to check that You are satisfied with the excess levels, exclusions, limitations, and other policy terms. We do not conduct a fair analysis of the insurance market prior to arranging insurance policies. \n\n1.12\n You agree to provide Us with details of any existing insurance policies which may, in the alternative, be applicable to Your needs. We have enclosed and asked you to complete a Funding Checks Form which We attach to the accompanying letter for that purpose. You agree that we shall not be liable to You for any losses you sustain as a result of Your failure to provide us with such details. \n\n1.13\n Should You decide to purchase a Legal Protection Insurance policy, the provider of that policy will be authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Should there be a complaint about the policy or its operation, then You should raise the matter with the provider of the policy. If the matter is not resolved, then complain to the Financial Ombudsman's Service at Exchange Tower, Harbour Exchange, London E14 9SR.\n\nInvestment and Other Advice\n\n1.14\n If You need advice on investments, or any structured settlement or similar proposed by Your opponent, we may refer You to someone who is authorised to provide the necessary advice under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. \n\n1.15\n We may provide a preliminary and incidental view on such matters, where they are closely connected with the matter we are acting on. However, such matters, are expressly excluded from the terms of this Agreement, and We shall not, under this Agreement or otherwise, be liable to You in respect of such viewpoint. \n\n1.16\n If We recommend You instruct a particular advisor, broker, accountant, agency or other business (in connection with professional or financial service or anything else), We shall do so in good faith and in Your best interests which shall be the limit of our liability to You. \n\n1.17\n If the person We recommend can only offer products from one source, We shall notify You in writing of this limitation. \n\n1.18\n We shall not be liable for any advice they may give You, and are advised that if they are not a practice of solicitors You will not have the regulatory protection of the SRA or of the SRA Codes of Conduct and SRA Indemnity Insurance Rules, nor shall you be entitled to the benefit of the SRA Compensation Fund\n\nCompensation and State Benefits\n\n1.20\n If You are receiving state benefits or support and awarded Compensation, entitlement to benefits/support may be reduced or stopped completely. Further, the capital threshold in is calculated\n\nper household, meaning any benefits/support claimed by Your partner may also be affected.\n\n1.21\n It is possible to safeguard Compensation from being calculated as part of capital through the use of a Personal Injury Settlement Trust. If you transfer your Compensation award to a Settlement Trust, you will still be obliged to notify the Benefits Agency of the existence of the Trust, but any capital held in it will be disregarded i.e. not count to the Capital Threshold. \n\n1.22\n You have 52 weeks from the date of any settlement or any interim payment to set up a Settlement Trust and there is no upper limit to the amount of capital that can be transferred to it. \n\n1.23\n As an alternative to setting up a Settlement Trust, if awarded compensation you may wish to seek financial advice generally. We are not authorised or qualified to give financial advice nor have the expertise to advise on the creation of Settlement Trusts. Should you wish us to suggest an independent financial adviser, let us know. \n\n1.24\n By entering this Agreement, you confirm that you have been advised of the above risks and of creating a Settlement Trust to protect benefits/support that you receive now or in the future. Accordingly, we shall not be held liable for any loss that you suffer as a result of the reduction or suspension of any benefits/support that you may receive now or in the future.\n\nRecommendations &amp; Authorities\n\n1.25\n Where we have paid a fee to anyone recommending our services, or in respect of any marketing activities undertaken on our behalf, you will have been informed of this in the accompanying letter.

BEFORE THE EVENT COVER\n\n3.1 We have asked You in the accompanying letter whether or not You have any insurance policies or membership of any trade or professional body which might provide You with legal expenses cover. If You cannot provide Us with a copy of the policy or membership provisions, simply note the insurer's details, policy number and the date of the policy on the form enclosed with Our letter and return it to Us.\n\n3.2\n Where cover can be pursued to Your advantage, We will inform the insurer that You have instructed us and seek their authority to act for You, and their confirmation that the policy covers Our costs and disbursements and any award of costs which may be made against You if Your Complaint does not succeed.\n\n3.3\n Where You have legal expenses insurance cover You are generally entitled to instruct a solicitor of Your choosing, do not have to refer the matter to whosoever the insurer nominates.\n\n3.4\n This Agreement is subject to a 'condition subsequent' and its provisions (but only in relation to payment other than where you are not in breach of the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement) will be substituted for Our acting, and being paid, under Your insurance policy where the insurer authorises Us to act and has agreed to pay Our Costs and Disbursements and You will not be responsible for payment of them where they have authorised and agreed payment of them provided that You are not in breach of the terms or conditions of Your policy or this Agreement.\n\n3.5\n We shall not be obliged to appeal or pursue refusal of cover, or failure to reply, by Your insurer. We are not obliged to act under such a policy, and will not do so, where the insurer will not pay Our reasonable charges for doing so.\n\n3.6\n Where Your insurer offers to instruct Us upon the qualified basis that they will only meet Our Basic Costs at a reduced hourly rate, then You may instruct us to accept such offer but You will be liable to pay us the balance of our Basic Costs at the full hourly rates as stated in the Contract Summary.\n\n3.7\n The provisions of this Agreement relating to matters other than payment to the extent stated above will continue to apply to Our retainer with You.\n\n4. RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nOur Responsibilities:\n\n4.1\n We are under a duty to supply goods and/or services to You which conform to this Agreement with You for the supply of those goods and/or services as set out in the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 and the Consumer Rights Act 2015, and to provide You with services in a timely and professional manner.\n\n4.2\n We have agreed to perform services on receipt of Your signed copy of this Agreement.\n\n4.3\n Instructions are noted in the accompanying letter. If We have misunderstood them in any material respect, We would ask You to immediately contact Us preferably in writing.\n\n4.4 We shall:\n\nAlways act in Your best interests (subject to Our duty to the court and obligations to Our regulator);\n\nGive You advice about whether to accept any offer of settlement.\n\nExplain to You the risks and benefits of taking legal action.\n\nGive You information whenever possible about the likely costs of the Complaint.\n\n4.5\n Instructing any firm of solicitors gives that firm authority to act on Your behalf, and to do all things reasonably necessary in furtherance of Your instructions.\n\n4.6\n We will seek authorisation before instructing Counsel, commissioning reports, issuing proceedings or entering into settlement on Your behalf. However, it is not practicable to do so every time that We work on Your file.\n\n4.7\n If You wish to place specific limits, monetary or otherwise, on what work We may do on Your behalf without further written authority, kindly inform Us in writing.\n\n4.8\n We will liaise with and advise You on any offers of settlement which We receive. We will not\n\naccept any offer without your written authority. We will advise you in writing whether or not, in Our judgment, any offer of settlement is reasonable.\n\n4.9\n Our instructions must come from You personally, cannot discuss Your Complaint with anyone else. provide them with information relating to it, unless You authorise Us in writing to do so (or it's provided for in these Terms and Conditions).\n\n4.10\n We are professionally and legally obliged to keep Your affairs confidential save and except where We are obliged to disclose matters by legal requirement.:\n\n4.11\n Your details may have to be disclosed in order to search government approved databases, such as the CUE PI Database. By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you give Us permission to do so.\n\n4.12\n Where You have an insurance policy in place to cover legal costs, We are obliged to periodically update insurers on progress on your instructions. This is ensures that You continue to be protected from having to pay any legal costs. We must notify Your insurers if and when any settlement offers are made, when court proceedings begin and/or if the prospects of success for Your Complaint fall below 50%. Again, by accepting these Terms and Conditions, you give Us permission to do so.\n\n4.13\n We may be required to make a disclosure to the National Crime Agency if we suspect or know that any litigation may involve money laundering or terrorism financing.\n\nYour Responsibilities:\n\n4.14 You must:\n\n· Give Us timely instructions that allow Us to do Your work properly;\n\n· Pay Disbursements (including barrister's fees, if appropriate) when required.\n\n· Ensure We have Your correct contact details (including contact details when are away for any length of time).\n\n· Not ask Us to work in an improper or unreasonable way.\n\n· Not exaggerate Your Complaint.\n\n· Not deliberately mislead Us or anyone acting on Our or Your behalf (including any expert instructed by Us).\n\n· fully co-operate and attend examination or court hearings. (You will be charged for any appointment or examination not attended without prior notified cause).\n\n4.15\n If now, or at any time in the future, any matter on which We act for You is the subject of contested proceedings, whether in the courts or other tribunals, You will be obliged to disclose documents, including electronic documents, relating to the matter. Ensure that You do not destroy (or allow anyone else to destroy) any documents which may have a bearing on the matter (however slight the connection may be), as Your legal position could be seriously compromised.\n\n5. COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS\n\n5.1\n You will not have to pay Our Fees where Your Claim does not succeed, provided that You are not in breach of this Fee Agreement or any policy of insurance under which We are acting for You (unless they have already become due by reason of Interim Hearing).\n\n5.2\n Where Your claim succeeds You shall be liable to pay Our fees stated in the Contract Summary.\n\n5.3\n Our Fees are not calculated by reference to the amount of time We spend on Your Claim (unless you are in breach of Fee Agreement of any policy of insurance under which We are acting for You) and may be higher or lower than they would have been where they calculated on that basis at the hourly rates in the Contract Summary in the event that your claim settles early. If you would prefer to instruct upon an hourly rate basis, kindly let us know in writing.\n\n5.4\n Having been fully informed of Our Fees, You agree to pay them. Accordingly there shall be no presumption relating to 'unusual costs' in Civil Procedure Rules rule 46.9(3)(c), and Section 74(3) of the Solicitors Act 1974 shall not apply, and We are not limited to charging You an Opponent's Fee\n\nContribution.\n\nDisbursement\n\n5.5\n Our anticipated Disbursements are as stated in the Contract Summary. We will notify You in written as to the actual costs of any of these when We are in a position to confirm them.\n\n5.6\n We have generally agreed (unless and to the extent stated in the accompanying letter) to defer reimbursement of expenses from You until the conclusion of Your Complaint.\n\n5.7\n We have indicated the expenses that may be incurred by Us in furtherance of Your Complaint. We shall provide further detail as Your Complaint progresses.\n\nRecoverability of Costs/Disbursements\n\n5.8\n The FOS and POS don't generally award Costs or Disbursements but will take them into account in the award that they make.\n\nOpponent's Costs and Disbursements\n\n5.9\n In practice you are not generally at risk of having to pay your opponent's costs before the FOS or the FSCS.\n\n6. ATE INSURANCE/COST RISK\n\n6.1\n As We have explained, unless you have the benefit of legal expenses insurance cover or similar, where Your Claim does not succeed You will have to pay our Disbursements, and may have to pay the costs and disbursements of Your opponent where the matter is pursued in the civil courts.\n\n6.2\n To protect You against this possibility We may recommend that You take out an insurance policy known as an 'After the Event' policy (ATE) which will cover this 'cost risk' and any Disbursements incurred.\n\n6.3\n You do not have to take out such a policy. Where You do, You will be liable to pay the premium to the insurer, which will usually be deferred until the conclusion of the Claim, and waived where it does not succeed.\n\n6.4\n ATE premiums can longer be recovered from Your opponent where Your Claim succeeds.\n\n6.5\n If We recommend that You obtain such a policy We may suggest a suitable policy to you and, on your instructions, will arrange inception as your agent. Similarly, if we do not believe that taking out a policy is in Your best interests We will advise accordingly.\n\n6.6\n We will set out the reasons why We believe that You need an ATE policy and why We believe the policy We have recommended meets those needs in a 'Demands and Needs' statement.\n\n7. INSTRUCTING COUNSEL\n\n7.1\n The cost of Advocacy and any other work by Us, or by any solicitor agent on Our behalf, forms part of Our Fees.\n\n7.2\n If a barrister is instructed, their terms and conditions will be shown in the separate fee agreement We make with the barrister. You must pay the barrister's fees, which are a Disbursement.\n\n7.3\n Where we are proposing to instruct Counsel (a barrister) to give an opinion, draft statements of Complaint or other court process, or to represent you at trial, We shall discuss their proposed instructions and how much their fees are likely to be, with You, and confirm such matters in writing, before We instructing them.\n\n7.2\n Barristers' fees range from between £300.00 - £1,000.00 a day (although We may be able to arrange a conditional fee agreement with the barrister in which case Your responsibility for these will be on the same basis as Our own charges).\n\n7.3 Instructing counsel is a Disbursement payable by You in any event unless you/we enter into a CFA with them.\n\n8. PAYMENT OF COSTS AND QUERIES ON BILLS\n\n8.1 Our Costs are payable as and when stated herein, and upon delivery of a bill of costs.\n\nPayments on Account\n\n8.2 We may have asked You to make payment on account of anticipated Disbursements in the accompanying letter. Payments on account are held in Our client account to Your credit until We have paid the anticipated Disbursement.\n\nDue Date for Payment and Interest\n\n8.3 Where We issue a bill payment is due within 28 days. If You fail to pay We may charge You interest (on a daily basis) on the unpaid element of the bill (at a rate no higher than the rate payable on judgment debts at the date of this Agreement). Unless otherwise agreed, the interest period will begin 28 days following the delivery of the bill until payment.\n\nQueries on Bills\n\n8.4 Our bills contain a brief narrative of the work that We have undertaken for you and the Disbursements that have been incurred to date. We can always provide a more detailed explanation of the work to which the bill relates upon request within three months of delivery of Our bill. \n\n8.5 Should You have any specific queries or concerns regarding any bill, we would ask You to inform us upon receipt. \n\n8.6 Where You feel we have not addressed your concerns, and We have not been able to resolve the matter under Our complaints procedures (see subsequent) You have a right to complain to the Legal Ombudsman Service for a period of three months from the date of issue.\n\nAssessment of Bills\n\n8.7 You also have the right to have the Bill assessed under Part III of the Solicitors' Act 1974. The procedure is set out in sections in section 57 of the Solicitors Act 1974 and paragraph 3 of the Solicitors' (Non-Contentious Business) Remuneration Order 2009 (the 2009 Order),\n\nDeductions from Compensation\n\n8.8 We are authorised by this Agreement to receive Compensation or any other payments to which you may become entitled from Your Opponent or a paying party, their representatives or insurers. \n\n8.9 You undertake not to accept or agree to accept any payments directly from your opponent, or any third party. You further agree to pay into an account designated by us any cheque received by you or by us from your opponent or third party and made payable to you. \n\n8.10 You further authorise us to deduct from Compensation received by us, prior to paying the balance to you, the undischarged balance of our Costs and Disbursements, and any ATE insurance premium where a policy has been taken out by You together any interest and VAT. \n\n8.11 Any monies recovered for third parties (and in respect of Disbursements such as expert's reports) will be repayable to them directly. However, the sums will frequently be included in the damages cheque made payable to You. Accordingly, We may pay Your damages monies directly into Our client account and make separate payments to You and the relevant third parties. \n\n8.12 We always make payments by cheque or bank transfer, won't make payments in cash or to a third party. Payments we make to You cannot be paid to any other party on Your behalf and We cannot\n\nmake payments to an overseas bank account (unless expressly agreed by special arrangement).\n\nVAT\n\n8.13\n None of Our fees, estimates or charges include VAT, unless We state otherwise, We charge VAT in addition at the prevailing rate at the time of the provision of Our services. VAT is payable on most disbursements, although court fees are currently exempt from VAT\n\nLien over Papers\n\n8.14\n Where you fail to pay a bill, We may exercise what is called a Lien over any papers relating to Your Complaint which We hold i.e. We may keep them and other property belonging to You until it is paid. We will only do this if it is reasonable in the circumstances with due consideration to ensuring Your position is not prejudiced and Your rights under applicable data legislation are not infringed.\n\n8.15\n In the alternative, where You have transferred instructions to other solicitors (when We shall issue a bill, where this Agreement entitles us to) We may, in the alternative to exercising a Lien over papers, agree to release the file to them, provided that they give an undertaking to pay Our costs within the stipulated or a reasonable time.\n\nInterest\n\n8.16\n If You fail to pay any of the fees which are due, We are at liberty to charge simple interest on the unpaid amount at a rate of 8 percent per annum, starting from the 31st day after We sent You the relevant invoice.\n\nIndemnity\n\n8.17\n You shall indemnify Us against all costs, charges and expenses (including legal costs) incurred by Us in enforcing Our rights against You under this agreement and shall do so notwithstanding any allocation to the Small Claims Track of any claim issued by Us in the County Court for that purpose and so that any such costs will be summarily assessed and added to the judgment debt\n\n9. CANCELLATION RIGHTS\n\n9.1\n Where You are a private individual who has instructed Us to undertake work unrelated to Your trade, business, craft or profession, You have a tight to cancel this Agreement under the Consumer Contract (Information, Cancellation, and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 within 14 days of the Commencement Date.\n\n9.2\n Instructions as to how to exercise Your rights of cancellation and a statutory cancellation notice can be found in the accompanying letter.\n\n9.3\n If you exercise Your right to cancel having already made an express request in writing for us to do the work urgently and before the cancellation period runs out then you are liable to pay Us our Costs for the work carried out up until you cancel the contract between Us. If the service has been fully performed at Your request prior to You cancelling the contract with us then You lose Your right to cancel and acknowledge that You have received notice of Your loss of right to cancel in such circumstances.\n\n10. TERMINATION AND DISCONTINUANCE\n\nWhere You Terminate this Agreement\n\n10.1\n You may otherwise terminate instructions upon reasonable written notice to Us.\n\n10.2\n Subject to the preceding Clause, should You do so, or discontinue Your instructions to Us, other than upon Our express written advice, or discontinue or abandon instructions We shall be entitled to charge You, and You shall be liable to immediately pay us, Our Costs and Disbursements incurred up to the date when We received notice of termination, or became aware of discontinuance or abandonment. We shall provide you with a narrative of the work undertaken and the amount of Our\n\noutstanding Costs together with any Disbursements which we have incurred on Your behalf.\n\n10.3\n Where instructions are terminated or You discontinue or abandon instructions to Us under Clause 10.2, We shall be entitled to charge for the work We have undertaken at the hourly rates stated in the Contract Summary.\n\n10.3\n Where You terminate instructions to Us after Compensation has been offered, which You subsequently accept directly or through the agency of any person, the Costs due to Us shall be deemed to the fees which we would have been entitled to as stated in the Contract Summary.\n\nTermination by Death\n\n10.4\n If You should die before your Complaint is concluded this may automatically terminate your instructions, and We will be entitled to recover Our Costs and Disbursements up to the date of Your death from Your estate.\n\n10.5\n However, if Your personal representative wishes to continue Your Complaint, they may agree to continue instructions on behalf of Your estate and adopt this Agreement by deed under seal.\n\nWhere We Terminate Instructions\n\n10.6\n We may terminate this Agreement by written notice, when You are in breach of it, and are obliged to do so where We reasonably believe that Your Complaint is fraudulent or dishonest or otherwise in contempt of court..\n\n10.7\n We are entitled to terminate instructions on Notice where We have not received a reply to correspondence for a period of 28 days. We shall give You written notice of Our intention of doing so.\n\n10.8\n We may terminate this Agreement where You have instructed Us against Our best advice to You, in respect of any settlement or more generally with regard to the conduct of the Complaint.\n\n10.9\n Where We terminate this Agreement under Clauses 10.6 to 10.8 We shall be entitled to charge You Our Costs incurred up to the date of receipt of notice of termination at the hourly rates stated in the Contract Summary together with Disbursements We have incurred.\n\n10.10\n We may terminate this Agreement if We consider in our professional judgement that Your Complaint is unlikely to succeed. You will not be charged our Costs, but You will be liable to pay any Disbursements which We have incurred\n\n10.11\n Where You reject a professional opinion regarding the acceptance of any offer of settlement of your Complaint, We may seek the independent opinion of counsel on the merits of the proposed settlement. If they agree with Us but you do not accept our/their advice, then You must pay our Costs, Disbursements and any insurance premium at that point.\n\n10.12\n If this Agreement is terminated, You agree to keep us informed of any new legal representative You instruct to pursue Your Complaint. You must also keep us advised of the outcome of Your Complaint, which shall include any settlement, judgment or final determination, even where You have not instructed any new legal representative.\n\n10.13\n After the Fee Agreement ends, We may apply to have Our name removed from the record of any court proceedings in which We are acting. You must agree to Our name being removed from the record. If the Fee Agreement has been terminated (as opposed to cancelled), You will be liable for Our costs incurred in making the application (which will be calculated at the hourly rates stated in the Contract Summary) plus Disbursements incurred in making the application.\n\n11. STORAGE OF PAPERS\n\n11.1\n Unless You have already asked Us to return any papers to You, We shall keep all files relating to your instructions in digital storage for not less than six years, either in their original form or on some other retrievable medium. After the end of that period, those files will be destroyed, although this shall not apply to any original documents that You have specifically asked Us in writing to keep in safe\n\ncustody for You.\n\n11.2 We do not normally make a charge for retrieving stored papers which relate to current matters, although we reserve the right to charge you for any time spent in retrieving papers relating to completed matters and for any time spent in reading the file, writing letters, or doing any other work requested.\n\n11.3 If You ask us to send any documents to anyone else, We shall not be liable for any loss or damage that occurs to those documents in transit after they leave our possession. You should also note that, unless We believe it appropriate to do so, We do not ordinarily make copies of any lengthy or bulky documentation that We send to anyone else, unless You specifically ask Us to do so, and pay Our copying charges.\n\n12. CLIENT ACCOUNT/ MONIES HELD\n\n12.1 Subject to the conditions set out in the SRA Accounts Rules, a fair sum of interest must be accounted to clients on client money. Our policy on interest shall be kept under review. The policy may change if the Bank of England base rate increases or decreases. At the date of the preparation of this policy, the interest rates payable on client accounts were extremely low - around 0.1% and the Bank of England base rate is 0.75%. This means that the sums of money involved are negligible.\n\n12.2 The rate of interest available on client accounts is significantly lower than the rate of interest which can be obtained on other bank or building society accounts. This reflects the fact that immediate access required to client accounts in order to comply with the accounts rules and to facilitate the smooth completion of transactions. It is therefore unlikely that the funds will attract as much interest as if You had invested those funds yourself.\n\n12.3 All interest arising from cleared funds held on behalf of a trust will be credited to the trust whether those funds are held in a general client account or a separate designated client account (formerly known as Designated Deposit Account).\n\n12.4 For cleared funds paid into general client accounts, the firm shall account for interest unless one of the following applies:\n\n(a) The amount of interest calculated on the balance held is £20.00 or less; or\n\n(b) The client money was held in cleared funds in client account for a period of five working days or less.\n\n12.5 All other clients shall be paid interest at the rate payable upon the firm's client account from time to time, unless there are specific circumstances which lead the client to contract out of the right to receive interest payments (for example where the client agrees the firm may keep interest payments to remunerate the firm for acting as stakeholder in the transaction or where the client's religious beliefs prohibit the receipt of interest).\n\n12.6 In certain circumstances separate designated client accounts will be opened on behalf of clients. All interest arising from funds held in separate designated client accounts will be credited to the client.\n\n12.7 Where sums of money are held in relation to separate matters for the same client, the money relating to the different matters shall be treated separately unless it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances to consider the sums together.\n\n12.8 Interest will not accrue on any advances from the Firm to fund a payment on behalf of a client or trust in excess of funds held for that client or trust.\n\n12.9 Where a client fails to present a cheque to his or her bank for payment We will not recalculate any amount due to the client unless it is fair and reasonable to do so, for example if the cheque has been sent to an incorrect address.\n\n12.10 We will usually account to You for interest arising under Our policy at the conclusion of your matter, but might, in some cases, consider it appropriate to account to You at intervals throughout.\n\n12.11 Unless otherwise agreed by Us in writing, if We receive any sums to hold on Your behalf (whether received directly from You or from a third party) then We may deposit such money into an account or accounts with any bank or financial institution (a \"deposit provider\" which expression shall include bank, financial institution or clearing house through which transfers are made) of Our choosing. We confirm that We comply with any applicable laws and any applicable rules of a regulatory authority in respect of the making of any such deposits. \n\n12.12 We shall not be liable for any loss which You or any third party may suffer in connection with an Insolvency Event occurring in relation to any deposit provider with whom We have deposited funds or through whom transfers are made, save if and to the extent that any such loss was caused by or contributed to by any breach by us of clause 12.13.\n\n12.13 In Clause 12.12 \"Insolvency Event\" means:\n\n(a) Any deposit provider is unable or admits inability to pay its debts as they fall due (or is deemed to be or declared to be unable to pay its debts under applicable law), suspends or threatens to suspend making payments on any of its debts or, by reason of actual or anticipated financial difficulties or commences negotiations with one or more of its creditors with a view to rescheduling any of its indebtedness; \n\n(b) The value of the assets of any deposit provider is less than its liabilities (taking into account contingent or prospective liabilities); \n\n(c) A moratorium is declared in respect of any indebtedness of any deposit provider; \n\n(d) Any corporate or government action, legal proceedings or other procedure or steps taken in relation to: \n\n(e) The suspension of payments, a moratorium of any indebtedness, winding-up, dissolution, administration or reorganisation (by way of voluntary arrangement, scheme of arrangement or otherwise) of any deposit provider; \n\n(f) A composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any creditor of any deposit provider; \n\n(g) The appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of any deposit provider or any of its assets; \n\n(h) Enforcement of any security interest (however so described) over any assets of any deposit provider; or \n\n(i) The prevention or restriction (whether by way of freezing order or otherwise) of a deposit provider's ability to dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of its assets or any of them\n\noccurring in any jurisdiction in respect of any deposit provider.\n\n12.14 If an Insolvency Event occurs in relation to any deposit provider which holds money that We have deposited on Your behalf, We will, where applicable, need to disclose to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme ('FSCS') all relevant details in our possession about You and the money that We hold on your behalf with such a deposit provider in order to make a Complaint for compensation on Your behalf. We will contact you to gain your consent if we need to make this disclosure Please note that by withholding consent to our disclosure of your details to the FSCS in such circumstances, You may forfeit any right You have to receive compensation from the FSCS where an Insolvency Event occurs in relation to a deposit provider holding money which We have deposited on Your behalf. Compensation for deposits is limited to £85,000 for any individual's total deposit with that service provider, including any personal finances. Further information regarding the FSCS can be found at www.fscs.org. uk, telephone number 020 7892 7300.\n\n13.

Please be aware that We may monitor correspondence travelling\n\nbetween You and any recipient at the firm as part of its monitoring activities to ensure compliance with its Information Management &amp; Security Policy.\n\n3.11\n Where you provide Us with fax or email addresses for sending material to, You are responsible for ensuring arrangements are sufficiently secure and confidential to protect Your interests. You must tell Us if this method of communication is not secure so that We can use an alternative method.\n\n3.12\n The Internet is not secure and there are risks if You send sensitive information in this manner or You ask Us to do so. Please be aware that the data We send by email is not routinely encrypted.\n\n3.13\n We will take reasonable steps to protect the integrity of Our computer systems by screening for viruses on email sent or received. We expect You to do the same for Your computer systems.\n\nTelephone communications\n\n13.14\n We will communicate with You by such methods as You request. More often than not this will be in writing but may be by telephone if it is appropriate.\n\n13.15\n We do not record incoming and outgoing telephone calls, however, if You call and leave a message and/or Your call is answered by an approved outsourced provider, Your call will be recorded for the following reasons\n\n(a) Quality monitoring: to help Us to monitor Our service levels;\n\n(b) Training: to help Us to identify training needs and provide training material from different scenarios We encounter when making or receiving telephone calls;\n\n(c) Complaints and disputes: to provide Us with additional information to help Us investigate complaints or disputes;\n\n(d) Staff protection: to provide Us with evidence in the event of abusive behaviour towards staff.\n\n13.16\n Our legal basis for recording calls is to protect Our legitimate interests in ensuring that We have the information available for the reasons stated above.\n\n13.17\n Call recordings may be disclosed to third parties if required to settle a dispute or report any abusive behaviour, or if required by law.\n\nSecurity of Data and Files\n\n13.18\n It is very unlikely that We will change Our bank account details during the course of Your matter.

You can do this by informing Your file handler or contacting our designated Data Protection Officer.\n\n14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n14.1\n You agree that the limitations on Our liability as set out in this agreement are reasonable having regard to the nature of Your instructions and the work involved and the availability and cost of professional indemnity insurance. We are, however, happy to consider options to increase these limitations, should you so require (which may result in an increase in fees).\n\n14.2\n We will undertake the work relating to Your matter with reasonable skill and care.\n\n14.3\n We accept liability without limit for the consequences of fraud by Us or any of Our directors, consultants or employees which is affected in their capacity as such for any other liability which We are not permitted by law or rules of professional conduct to limit or exclude. If any part of this agreement which seeks to exclude, limit or restrict liability (including provisions limiting the amount We will be required to pay or limiting the time You have to bring a Complaint) is found by a court to be void or ineffective for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be effective.\n\n14.4\n We will not be liable under this Agreement or laws of negligence for any deficiencies in the work we have undertaken if and to the extent they are due to any false, misleading or incomplete information or documentation provided to Us (whether by You or any third party) or due to the acts or omissions of You or any third party, provided always that where any failure by Us to identify any such false, misleading or incomplete information (or any failure by Us to inform You We have identified such\n\ninformation or any failure to act on your resulting instructions constitutes negligence then We shall, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, remain liable for such failure.\n\n14.5\n Despite anything else contained in this Agreement, We are not under any obligation to act for You (or to continue to act for You) if to do so would breach any professional rules or applicable laws. Therefore, We will not be responsible or liable to You for any loss which You or any other party may suffer as a result of Our refusal to proceed where We would be in breach (or We reasonably believe that We would breach) of Our legal obligations or professional rules.\n\n14.6\n Our total aggregate liability, subject to the preceding provisions of, and under or in connection with, this Agreement (including any addition or variation to it), whether for breach of contract, negligence, breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, shall not exceed the maximum amount of Our Professional Indemnity Insurance cover (being £3MK) supplemented by the cover you authorised us to incept on any 'top up' insurance .\n\n14.7\n Where we are instructed jointly by more than one party, the limit on Our liability applies, in total, to all of you collectively (including anyone Complainting through You or on your behalf).\n\n14.8\n You agree that You will not bring any Complaints or proceedings in connection with this Agreement against Our directors, consultants or employees personally, unless (and to the extent that) You are otherwise permitted to do so by law or our professional rules. Our employees may enforce this clause even though they are not parties to this Agreement (but despite having such rights, this Agreement may be varied or ended without their consent).\n\n14.9\n Proceedings in respect of any Complaint against Us must be commenced within six years after You first had (or ought reasonably to have had) both the knowledge for bringing an action for damages and the knowledge that You had the right to bring such an action and in any event no later than six years after any alleged breach of contract, negligence or other cause of action. This provision expressly overrides any statutory provision which would otherwise apply; it will not increase the time within which proceedings may be commenced and may reduce it.\n\n14.10\n If We and any other party or parties are liable to You together in respect of the same Complaint, then We shall only be liable to pay You the portion which is found to be fair and reasonable having regard to the level of Our default. Therefore, We shall not be liable to pay You the portion which is due to the fault of such party, even if You do not recover all or any money from such other party for any reason.\n\n14.11\n If We are liable to You and any other party or parties would have been found liable to You together with Us in respect of the same Complaint if either:\n\n(a) You had also brought proceedings or made a Complaint against them; or\n\n(b) We had brought proceedings or made a Complaint against them for a contribution towards our liability,\n\nthen any sum due from Us to You shall be reduced by the proportion for which such other party or parties would have been found liable had those proceedings been brought or those Complaints been made.\n\n14.12\n Nothing in this agreement excludes or limits the liability of the Firm for:\n\n(a) Death or personal injury caused by negligence;\n\n(b) Fraud/fraudulent misrepresentation;\n\n(c) Any liability if and to the extent that it is not permissible in law for such liability to be limited or excluded.\n\n15. EQUALITY &amp; DIVERSITY\n\n15.1\n We are committed to promoting equality and diversity in all of our dealings with clients, third parties and employees. Please contact Us if you would like a copy of Our Equality and Diversity Policy.\n\nIf You have any special requirements in relation to the way in which You would like Us to handle Your work, (for example, if you consider yourself to have a disability) please let Us know..\n\n16. CLIENT CARE AND COMPLAINTS\n\n16.1\n We aim to understandable, prompt and courteous. \n\n16.2\n We shall keep You fully informed about all developments in your instructions and will respond to Your letters, emails and telephone calls promptly and efficiently. \n\n16.3\n The vast majority of Our clients are very happy with the service We provide, but if You have any cause for concern, and cannot resolve this with your lawyer, then please contact, by telephone or in writing to emailing the Director at our office. We take all feedback from clients seriously and operate a Complaints Handling Procedure, a copy of which is available upon request. \n\n16.4\n We are usually able to deal with any concerns You have promptly and to Your satisfaction, but if we have not managed to resolve matters within 8 weeks of the date of Your complaint (and any further period of appeal under such procedures) then you have a right to raise the matter with the Legal Ombudsman, provided You do so within six months of the end of our internal complaints procedure. \n\n16.5\n In addition, You should ordinarily notify the of Your complaint within 1 year when You were or should have become reasonably aware of the cause of your complaint. Time limits are set out in the Legal Ombudsman's Scheme Rules. The Rules can be referenced at:\n\nWebsite: www.legalombudsman.org.uk\n\n16.6\n The Legal Ombudsman can be contacted at: \n\n(a) PO Box 6806, Wolverhampton, WV1 9WJ \n\n(b) Telephone: 0300 555 0333 \n\n(c) enquiries@legalombudsman.org.uk \n\n16.7\n Ordinarily, a complainant cannot refer a matter to the Legal Ombudsman unless the complainant has first used a solicitor's internal complaints procedure, and: \n\n(a) The complaint has not been resolved to the complainant's satisfaction within 8 weeks of first making the complaint to the firm; \n\n(b) or an Ombudsman considers that there are exceptional reasons to consider the complaint sooner, or, without it having been made to the firm first; or \n\n(c) where an Ombudsman considers that in house resolution is not possible due to irretrievable breakdown in the relationship between the firm and the complainant.\n\nFinancial Ombudsman Service or the Courts?\n\nA claim or counter-claim for misrepresentation, breach of contract or regulatory requirement may lie before the courts in respect either against the Supplier or the Lender.\n\nYou will, in the main, need to prove your claim and the losses which you have incurred in consequence on a balance of probabilities. However, court fees and lawyer's costs for bringing civil claims can deter claimants. Where your claim does not succeed, you are at risk of having to pay part at least your opponent's costs where your claim is in excess of £10,000. We refer to costs in more detail in the Terms and Conditions or our retainers\n\nThe Financial Ombudsman (FOS) was established to offer an alternative forum for such matters. They can hear complaints against any person or body which is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in connection with financial products or investment advice provided that the complaint is brought within 6 years of the event complained of, or within 3 years of you being aware (or from when you should reasonably have been aware) that you had grounds to complain. These limits can be extended by the FOS in extenuating circumstances. There is no application fee for making a complaint (unlike the courts who charge issue and process fees). The FOS rarely award costs, and never against a complainant.\n\nA complaint must first be made to the Lender under their internal complaints procedures (if they have provided you with details of any, which they are supposed to do). They are afforded a period of 8 weeks to investigate the matter and make a final decision in respect of your complaint. Much depends upon the presentation of your complaint, and the arguments which are put to them as to why it should be settled. A settlement can sometimes be agreed at this stage, particularly where there have been similar claims in the past.\n\nIf matters cannot be agreed, then a formal complaint has to be put to the FOS. You have a period of 6 months from the final decision to do so. The complaint is initially dealt with by an appointed Adjudicator, who has specialist experience in the type of matter you are complaining about. They will usually arrive at a provisional decision, and invite comments from the parties, before reaching a final decision. The process is by way of written presentation and supporting evidence. Hearings (which usually take place in London at the offices of the FOS) are relatively rare, only take place after the Adjudicator's provisional decision, and can be requested by either party on grounds that it is necessary to the fair disposal of the complaint. This contrasts with the courts, where you will have to attend court and give evidence, where proceedings are issued, and the case doesn't settle.\n\nThe FOS can make both Awards - that is, order the other party to pay a sum in compensation to you -\n\nand issue Directions e.g. rectify the information which it holds about you such as credit information, or reduce interest rates etc. They can award up to £150,000, and recommend that the Advisor pay you a sum in excess of the maximum award (but the Advisor or Advisor is not obliged to pay this). If you accept an FOS Award, it is the generally accepted view that you cannot go to the court and sue for the balance, where your losses are in excess of this.\n\nEither party may appeal the Adjudicator's final decision (about 1 in 10 decisions are appealed) to one of the Ombudsmen, stating their grounds for doing so. The Ombudsman's decision is final. If it is in your favour, and you accept the award (note: you will be given 14 days to accept) then it is binding on the Lender. If they find for the Lender, however, it is not binding on you, and you will have to bring a civil claim in the courts. Although the process is intended to be less formal than the courts, the FOS do tend to follow previous decisions in the same way courts follow judicial precedent.\n\nThe advantage of Awards is that they can be enforced in the civil courts in the same way as a judgment of the courts. Furthermore, if they don't pay you within a reasonable time, then a complaint of misconduct lies to the FCA.\n\nThat is small comfort, if the Advisor has gone out of business. A great many brokers and lenders have gone to the wall since the pandemic. In such circumstances, a claim can be made under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), and where the FOS has already made an Award and the Advisor is insolvent, they will refer the matter to them.\n\nAll of this is fine in theory but it is the experience of a significant number of clients is that the FOS does not always adjudicate matters even-handedly when it comes to making awards against financial institutions, can be deaf to good legal argument when it does not accord with current FCA thinking.\n\nAll of this is fine in theory, but it is the experience of a significant number of clients is that the FOS does not always adjudicate matters even-handedly when it comes to making awards against financial institutions, can be deaf to good legal argument when it does not accord with current FCA thinking.\n\nIn which case your only recourse is through the courts…\n\nYou have a period of 6 years from the date from the date of breach on contract to bring an historic claim. The Small Claims Limit (above which you can reclaim costs at the court rate) is £10,000 compensation claimed.\n\nFUNDING OPTIONS\n\nYour Costs and Disbursements\n\nThere are a number of different ways to fund a financial services claim:\n\nLegal Aid:\n Legal Aid is generally no longer available to fund civil claims.\n\nFunding on a Private Estimate Retainer Basis:\n Win or lose, you will be liable to pay our Basic Charges, which will depend upon the amount of time which we spend on your instructions at the hourly rates stated in our retainer, and our Disbursements (expenses). Where your claim succeeds in the courts you may recover very costs (and most Disbursements).\n\nFunding Through A Third Party:\n You may have the benefit of legal expenses cover by virtue of your membership of a trade union, trade association or professional body, or under the terms of your employment. If you are a member of a trade union or believe that your employer may fund your claim then let us know and we will check that they are happy to do so and for you to instruct us.\n\nLegal Expenses Insurance:\n Legal Expenses Insurance cover may protect you against having to pay our costs and any expenses we incur in acting (these charges are known as 'disbursements') and it may also protect you against the risk of having to pay the Defendant's legal fees and expense if you lose your case. Legal Expenses Insurance is often contained within other types of insurance policies such as Home Contents or your motor policy. A few people have taken out separate Legal Expenses\n\nInsurance Policies. We have enclosed herewith a 'Funding Checks Form' for your completion. Please verify whether your policies or any policies belonging to your spouse or partner contain legal expenses insurance. Some insurers have their own panel of solicitors, so you will need to check that your insurers will cover us for acting for you. If you have any doubts then let us know and we will investigate it for you. If you do not tell us that you may have existing cover, then we will proceed on the basis that you do not.\n\nNon-contentious Business Agreement (NCBA)\n under which you will not pay our fees unless we are successful in getting an Order for Repair and/or compensation when you will pay us the percentage of your compensation stated in the Contract Summary; coupled with\n\nConditional Fee Agreement (CFA)\n (often described as a 'no win, no fee' agreement) which shall only apply if we advise you to issue proceedings against the landlord, although that merits further explanation.\n\n- If your Claim is not successful you will not be liable for our Costs but will have to pay any Disbursements we have incurred, which will be deferred until the conclusion of your Claim so long as you are not in breach of the agreement or any ATE insurance policy\n\n- If your claim succeeds you pay our Basic Costs and Disbursements plus a Success Fee (which is calculated as a percentage of our Basic Costs subject to statutory cap (as stated in the Contract Summary) of your Compensation.\n\nThe Success Fee has been set in accordance with the risk assessment which is contained in the accompanying letter to you.\n\nWe cap our unrecovered costs under a CFA at the agreed percentages of your compensation as stated in the Contract Summary..\n\nWe provide further information about this in the accompanying client letter to you and in the Contract Summary and CFA Terms and Conditions.\n\nDamages-Based Agreement:\n It is now possible to fund such claims on the basis of what is known as a Damages-Based Agreement. Such arrangements are so disadvantageous to solicitors under legislation, that neither we, nor any other solicitors whom we are aware of, are willing to enter into them, other than in respect of such claims. You may, of course, find someone who is willing to offer this type of funding.\n\nKindly note: this information is only published as general guidance without any considered advice on the particular circumstances of your claim, and, of itself, no liability shall attach to the publication of this guidance." };
